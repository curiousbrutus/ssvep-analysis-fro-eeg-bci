An executive summary of the paper:
The paper investigates how many people could effectively use a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI). SSVEPs are brain signals elicited by flickering visual stimuli, which can be detected in EEG signals and used for BCI control.
The study involved 53 participants who had never used a BCI before. Participants focused on one of four LED lights flickering at different frequencies while their EEG was recorded from 8 electrodes. Data was analyzed in real-time to detect which frequency the user was attending to.
Key findings:

SSVEP BCIs could provide effective communication for all 53 participants, with a grand average accuracy of 95.5%.
96.2% of subjects reached an accuracy above 80%.
50.9% of subjects reached perfect 100% accuracy.
Nobody performed below 60% accuracy after a few training runs.
Even brief training without feedback could improve performance for some initially lower-performing subjects.

The results suggest that SSVEP BCIs can achieve very high accuracy levels across a wide population after minimal training time. The authors conclude that SSVEP BCIs represent a viable option for providing communication ability when other BCI approaches may fail for some users.
